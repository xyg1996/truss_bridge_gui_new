Translation of calculation assistant
************************************

As soon as the calculation assistant's implementation is finished, it is time to translate it to other languages.

In order to supply translation of the calculation assistant to other languages than default one, the following procedure has to be applied.

Pre-requisites
==============

.. table::

    ====================== ===================================================================
    **Tool**               **Description**
    ====================== ===================================================================
    *asterstudy_assistant* This script is a part of the *AsterStudy* application.

                           It is used to generate Python module for the calculation assistant
                           from the declaration file.

    *pylupdate*            This script is a part of the *AsterStudy* application: if you work
                           from the source tree of *AsterStudy*, it can be found in the
                           *cmake* sub-directory; otherwise find it in the bin sub-directory
                           of the install tree.

                           This script is used to extract translation resources from the
                           Python source code in the form suitable for Qt *lupdate* tool.

    *lupdate*              This executable is a part of *Qt*. Use *lupdate* supplied with the
                           SALOME distribution.

                           The *lupdate* tool is used to generate / update translation source
                           file, with ``.ts`` extension.

    *linguist*             This executable is a part of *Qt*. Use *linguist* supplied with the
                           SALOME distribution.

                           This program can be used to translate source resource file to the
                           target language.

    *lrelease*             This executable is a part of *Qt*. Use *lrelease* supplied with the
                           SALOME distribution.

                           The *lrelease* tool is used to compile translation source file to
                           the binary form (with ``.qm`` extension), which can be loaded by
                           the application.

Translation procedure
=====================

1. Generate wizard file
-----------------------

The following command will generate a Python module for the calculation assistant from the declaration file.
More details about command line tool can be found :ref:`here <assistant-cmd-line-tool>`.

.. code-block:: bash

    asterstudy_assistant generate /path/to/assistant/directory

**Note**: resulting Python module is only needed to extract the translation resources. It can be removed then since *AsterStudy* allows automatic generation of calculation assistant in runtime from the description file (which is mandatory in this case). However, generated wizard module can be kept - in this case it will be loaded by *AsterStudy* automatically. Also, keeping wizard module can be needed if it contains some customization added manually.

2. Extract translations
-----------------------

To extract translation resources from the wizard file use ``pylupdate`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    pylupdate -e py -o /tmp/translation.py /path/to/assistant/directory

**Note**: the output file is used only temporarily (see next step), so arbitrary file path can be used. However, the file should have .py extension, otherwise *lupdate* tool will fail.

3. Update translation file
--------------------------

Use *Qt* ``lupdate`` tool to generate / update source translation file:

.. code-block:: bash

    lupdate -extensions py -locations none -no-obsolete /tmp/translation.py -ts /path/to/assistant/directory/wizard_msg_fr.ts

**Note**: The target language is automatically computed by lupdate from the name of the translation file, when it is first time launched. In above example, the source language will be *English* (default) and target language will be *French*.
Type ``lupdate -h`` to learn more about available options.

4. Translate calculation assistant
----------------------------------

Use *Qt* ``linguist`` tool to translate the source ``.ts`` file to the target language. The translations are written to the same ``.ts`` file.

5. Compile translation file
---------------------------

Compile source translation file to the binary form with the *Qt* ``lrelease`` tool:

.. code-block:: bash

    lrelease /path/to/assistant/directory/wizard_msg_fr.ts -qm /path/to/assistant/directory/wizard_msg_fr.qm

6. Deploy translation file
--------------------------

Deploy resulting translation file with your calculation assistant.
It will be automatically picked up by the *AsterStudy* application when the calculation assistant is launched.

Notes for developers of AsterStudy application
----------------------------------------------

When developing *standard* calculation assistants which are deployed with the *AsterStudy* application, use the following procedure in order to create translations:

a) Create a dedicated sub-directory in the ``resources/assistants`` folder and put new assistant there.

b) Perform steps 1-4 of above written procedure. Use a unique name for the source translation file (better using some significant name describing the nature of the assistant, e.g. ``IsotropicLineaElasticity_msg_fr.ts``).

c) Do not compile/deploy translation file as it will be done automatically by install procedure of *AsterStudy* application.

d) Add new translation to the ``resources`` section of ``resources/SalomeApp.xml.in`` file, e.g.:

.. code-block:: xml

    <section name="resources">
        <parameter name="IsotropicLineaElasticity" value="%ASTERSTUDY_ROOT_DIR%/share/salome/resources/asterstudy" />
    </section>

In this was the resource file will be automatically loaded on the *ASTERSTUDY* module activation in SALOME.

e) Small trick: in order to have translated name of the calculation wizard in the menu of *AsterStudy* application, add ``translator`` option to the wizard's :ref:`configuration file <assistant-cfg>`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [General]
    translator = IsotropicLinearElasticity

Case Management
***************

Backup case
===========

It is possible to save a case without executing it in order to keep intermediate
versions of the case and to be able to resume them later.

This can be done, either in the *History View* or the *Case View*, by selecting
*Operation > Back Up* menu or the *Back Up* entry in the context menu of a case.

Saved cases are shown in a separate subfolder in the *History View*.

Remove execution
================

It is possible to delete the results of an execution (provided that its results
are not used by other executions).

To do this, select the run case to delete, then the *Delete* button on the
toolbar, the *Edit > Delete* menu, or the *Delete* entry in the context menu.

Examine calculation
===================

The user can see the contents of an executed case. To do this, select the case
in the *History View*, then the *View Case* entry of the context menu. The case
details can then be viewed *in read-only mode* in the *Case View*.

    **Read-only view**

This feature is useful because it allows viewing the details of the commands
that make up the stages of given run case. Indeed, between two calculations
the user has the possibility to modify the parameters of the commands, to add
or to delete commands on the stages. The commands executed during a calculation
can thus be different from those of the current case.

Add description
===============

The user is able to add a description to each *Run case* or *Backup case*. This
can be done with the *Edit Description* item in the *Operations* main menu or
context menu.

Create case
===========

The initial empty case is automatically added to a study when it is created.
However, it is possible to remove all contents of the *Current Case* and create
new empty case. This can be done with *New Case* operation.

Export case
===========

The content of the study case can be exported to the files with the *Export Case*
operation which is available in *Operations* main menu and in context menu.
This operation creates an *.export* file and puts stages as properly named
*.com?* files near it. Input data files are put near the *.export* file.

Import case
===========

The content of the study can be imported from the *.export* file.
Use *Import Case* item in *Operations* main menu to do this.

Description
===========

The *Data Files* panel of the *Case View* allows managing input and output files
used by a case.

    **Data Files panel**

The user can view / edit data files when selecting a case, stage or command item
in the *Data Settings* panel. In each case the *Data Files* panel displays all
data files referenced by selected item.

The *Unit* column displays an internal unique identifier of the data file within
the study.

The *Mode* column shows type of the data file: *in*, *out* or *inout*.

The *Exists* column indicates whether the file exists on the disk or not.

The *Embedded* column indicates whether the file is embedded into the study or not.

In *graphical* mode files are automatically added by the application. For each
file, the *Data Files* panel shows the commands which refer to this file, as child
items (see image above).

In *text* mode the user must manually add the files he declares when describing
the commands. For this purpose, the *Add file* and *Remove file* buttons
in the *Data Files* panel's toolbar can be used.

In the Gnome environment (``Gio`` and ``GLib`` Python modules are required for
this feature), the file browser allows selecting files on a remote server.
By default, the remote servers are not automatically connected at startup.
The user can change this behavior in *File > Preferences*.
To manually connect the remote servers, use
*Operations > Connect remote servers* menu.
The remote filesystems are automatically unmounted when the Study is closed.
The remote servers are declared in the resources of the SALOME *JobManager*
module.

Embedded files
==============

The data files can be embedded into the SALOME study file (HDF format). This
has the advantage of being able to move the study file from one location to
another without worrying about having to move other files.

Embed file
----------

To embed a file, the user selects the file in the *Data Files* panel, and then
checks the *Embedded* box in the context menu.

Detach file
-----------

To detach a file from the study, the user must proceed in the same way to uncheck
*Embedded* box from context menu. The user will be prompted where he wants to put
the detached file.

Open With
=========

The user can open the data file for viewing or editing in the AsterStudy or in an
external application with the following operations:

* *Open In Editor* opens selected file for editing in an internal or external
  editor, depending on the preferences option,
* *Open In ParaVis* opens selected MED file in SALOME ParaVis module,
* *Open With* submenu allows opening selected file in any program by user's
  choice.

Summary
=======

The summary on the data files used within the study case can be viewed in the
*Data Files Summary* panel of the *History View*.
Here user can see all used data files and, if necessary, quickly modify
a path for each data file.

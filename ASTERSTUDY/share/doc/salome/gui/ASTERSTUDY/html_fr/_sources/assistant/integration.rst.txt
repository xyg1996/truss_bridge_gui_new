Integration with AsterStudy
***************************

*AsterStudy* application automatically detects user-defined calculation assistants
located in the user's home directory ``~/.config/salome/asterstudy_assistants``.
The possibility to configure locations of calculation assistants will be added
in the application in future.

In the application, available calculation assistants are listed in the main menu
*Operations > Add Stage Using Assistant*, or from the context menu for the *Case*
item in the *Data Settings* panel.

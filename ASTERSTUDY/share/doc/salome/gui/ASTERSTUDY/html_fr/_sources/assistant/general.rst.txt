General description
*******************

Graphical User Interface of *Calculation Assistant* is represented in form of
*wizard* dialog, consisting of a set of *pages* which contain input controls.
The user fills in the parameters of study case by browsing between the *pages*
and entering input values in the corresponding controls.

The GUI of each *assistant* is automatically generated by *AsterStudy* from
the description specified in the :ref:`declaration file <assistant-declaration>`.
In addition to the *dynamic* approach, it is possible to generate *static*
implementation of the *assistant* dialog and then introduce an additional needed
customization (like implementing specific verification rules, embedding custom
widgets, adding specific business logic to manage relations between different
controls, etc).

Pressing *Finish* button on the last page of assistant's *wizard* dialog creates
a stage in the study, by inserting data entered by the user to the
:ref:`template file <assistant-template>` supplied with the *assistant* and
importing result into the *AsterStudy*.

    **Calculation Assistant workflow**

In general, each *Calculation Assistant* is represented by a directory containing
a set of files:

- :ref:`Template file <assistant-template>`, representing a template of stage
  written in **Code_Aster** language;
- :ref:`Declaration file <assistant-declaration>`, describing GUI behavior
  of a calculation assistant;
- *Optionally*, :ref:`Wizard implementation <assistant-wizard>`, which can
  include additional customization of GUI behavior;
- *Optionally*, :ref:`Configuration file <assistant-cfg>`;
- *Optionally*, :ref:`Translation file <assistant-translation>`.

From this list, only *template* and *declaration* files are mandatory.
In addition to listed files, other files can be present - once generated from
the *declaration file*, wizard implementation can be freely extended to fit
particular assistant's needs.

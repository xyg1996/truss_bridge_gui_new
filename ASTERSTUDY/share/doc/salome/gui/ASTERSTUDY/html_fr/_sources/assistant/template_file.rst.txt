*************
Template file
*************

Creating of a new *Calculation Assistant* starts with writing of a **template
file**.

Template is a ``.comm`` file containing the description of a stage in the
**Code_Aster** language, with one or more parameters declared using special
syntax **%PARAM%** (where **PARAM** is a name of the particular parameter).

**Example**:

.. code-block:: python

    DEBUT()
 
    ...
 
    mat1 = DEFI_MATERIAU(ELAS=_F(E=%E%,
                                 NU=%NU%,),
                         TRACTION=_F(SIGM=REEL,),)
 
    mat2 = DEFI_MATERIAU(ELAS=_F(E=%E%,
                                 NU=%NU%,),)
 
    mesh = LIRE_MAILLAGE(FORMAT='MED', UNITE=%UNITE%)
 
    ...

    FIN()

Also, template file can include conditional blocks which will automatically
expand depending on the choice made in the wizard dialog. The conditional blocks
have the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    %PARAM=VALUE{
    # code block which is inserted if PARAM has value VALUE
    }%
    
    %PARAM=OTHER_VALUE{
    # code block which is inserted if PARAM has value OTHER_VALUE
    }%

.. warning::
    Currently, enclosed conditional blocks are not supported, i.e. it is not
    possible to insert one conditional block into another one.

The GUI controls representing particular parameters within the wizard dialog
are configured via the :ref:`declaration file <assistant-declaration>`.

See more detailed example in :ref:`Examples section <assistant-example>`.

Introduction
************

A *Calculation Assistant* is a predefined study accompanied by a graphical
interface allowing the user to enter certain parameters, and thus to be able
to quickly start a calculation.

*Calculation Assistant* can be considered as a *parameterized template* which
describes some particular study case. In this way, by entering just a minor set
of parameters, the user can easily set-up such a study case and launch
calculations.

*AsterStudy* application introduces a possibility to easily implement calculation
assistants. Several pre-defined assistants are supplied with the application, but the
user can create own assistants and embed them into *AsterStudy*.

This guide provides a description of a *Calculation Assistant* feature, and
gives detail instructions about creating and embedding custom assistants.

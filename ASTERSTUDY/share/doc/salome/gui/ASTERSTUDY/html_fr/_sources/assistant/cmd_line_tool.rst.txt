Each command has its own set of options described in the following paragraphs.

Generate assistant
==================

The command **generate** can be used to generate the file *wizard.py* on the
basis of declaration file *declaration.json*. By default, the file *wizard.py*
is created in the same folder where the *declaration.json* is located. It is
possible to specify a path to the declaration file, as well as to the output
wizard file.

The command line syntax of **generate** command is the following:

.. code-block:: none

    usage: asterstudy_assistant generate [-h] [-d FILE] [-w FILE] folder

    Generate calculation assistant wizard.

    positional arguments:
      folder                       directory with the wizard description file

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help                   show this help message and exit
      -d FILE, --declaration FILE  declaration file (default: declaration.json)
      -w FILE, --wizard FILE       wizard file (default: wizard.py)

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    asterstudy_assistant generate /home/user/asterstudy/my_assistant

Run assistant
=============

The command **run** shows a wizard dialog either from previously generated file
*wizard.py*, or directly from the declaration file *declaration.json*.

When the dialog is accepted (user presses *Finish* button), the runner parses
the parameterized template file (*template.comm* by default), substitutes the
parameters with the values from the wizard and generates an output file
(*stage.comm* by default), which is ready for import in *AsterStudy* application.

The command line syntax of **run** command is the following:

.. code-block:: none

    usage: asterstudy_assistant run [-h] [-d FILE] [-w FILE] [-t FILE] [-o FILE] folder

    Run calculation assistant wizard.

    positional arguments:
      folder                       wizard directory

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help                   show this help message and exit
      -d FILE, --declaration FILE  declaration file; needed only if wizard file does not
                                   exist, in which case wizard is generated from description
                                   (default: declaration.json)
      -w FILE, --wizard FILE       wizard file (default: wizard.py)
      -t FILE, --template FILE     template file (default: template.comm)
      -o FILE, --output FILE       output comm file; relative path is interpreted as a
                                   sub-path within wizard directory (default: stage.comm)

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    asterstudy_assistant run /home/user/asterstudy/my_assistant

Verify assistant
================

The command **verify** can be used to check validity of the calculation wizard.

.. warning:: This command is not implemented yet!

Pack assistant
==============

The command **pack** creates a ZIP archive with the calculation wizard.

The command line syntax of **pack** command is the following:

.. code-block:: none

    usage: asterstudy_assistant pack [-h] [-d FILE] [-w FILE] [-t FILE] [-o FILE] folder

    Pack calculation assistant wizard to archive.

    positional arguments:
      folder                       wizard directory

    optional arguments:

      -w FILE, --wizard FILE       wizard file (default: wizard.py)
      -t FILE, --template FILE     template file (default: template.comm)
      -o FILE, --output FILE       output archive file; relative path is interpreted
                                   as a sub-path within wizard directory; if not
                                   specified, default file name is used (default: None)

Example:

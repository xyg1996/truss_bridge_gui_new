Known issues
************

This section lists the known issues that are not yet fixed at the time of
delivery of this version.

In the management of the study
==============================

Use of special characters in filenames
--------------------------------------

It is advised not to use special characters (blanks, accentuated characters,
non ASCII characters, such as @, !, /, #, %, $ etc...) in filenames, be it for the name of the study (*.hdf* file)
or the input and output files.
This may indeed lead to difficulties in:

- launching of calculations (blanks);
- saving of the study (accents);
- opening of results in the *ParaViS* module (accents).

The application emits a warning if you select an incorrectly named file.

Loading a study
---------------

When one reloads a study (*File > Open*, with a *.hdf* file), the interface does
not switch immediately to *AsterStudy*.
One just needs to click on the *AsterStudy* icon.

In the data settings
====================

``POST_RELEVE_T`` command
-------------------------

During the edition of the ``POST_RELEVE_T`` command, the link with the mesh is not
activated until the modifications of the ``ACTION`` factor keyword or the whole command
are validated.

``INCLUDE_MATERIAU`` command
----------------------------

The ``FICHIER`` keyword accepts a filename to be included as a string.
The application can not know anything about this file.

**Workaround**: Insert a *Stage* in text mode above the *Stage* that uses the
``INCLUDE_MATERIAU`` command and declare the file as input, choose a free
logical unit number. Then modify the value of ``FICHIER`` by ``fort.NN`` with
the choosen unit number.

Commands data settings
----------------------

For a better user experience (especially for mesh interaction), it is necessary
to make sure that all compulsory keywords of the first level of edition are filled
before editing a keyword with a second level of edition.

Beware that mandatory keywords may sometimes be located at the bottom of the edition panel
(for instance the keyword ``MODELE`` in ``AFFE_CHAR_MECA`` command).

Performance of mesh view
------------------------

Mesh-related commands display a mesh and selected groups in the central area of
the application window. For large mesh files, with big number of groups, the
visualization of mesh data can be quite time-consuming.

**Workaround**: it is possible to disable visualization operations by switching
mesh view off. This can be done by unpressing *Show Mesh View* button in the
toolbar.

In the management of data files
===============================

Adding files in *Data Files* panel
----------------------------------

When manually adding a file in text mode, it is necessary to validate the
right panel with the **OK** button after selecting the file in the dialog box.

Adding files host on remote server
----------------------------------

For EDF users, the cluster EOLE and ATHOS are automatically mounted when opening the *AsterStudy* module.
When specifying a remote file, the sidebar of the file explorer opens the root directory "/".
After selecting the wanted cluster, the user must enter "home/NNI" or "scratch/NNI" in the text field
at the top to access directly his usual directories.

In the management of calculations
=================================

Using remote Databases option
-----------------------------

When launching a runcase, if the "Remote databases" field has been filled in and checked, the log file is not accessible in "Show
message file" combobox (only "message" and "export" files are available).
If the "Remote databases" field is filled but not checked (greyed field) the same phenomenon is observed.
The parameter "Remote databases" should not be modified, if the user does so, a fatal error occurs when launching the computation.


Other issues
============

.. _userguide-known-issues-recovery-mode:

In case of error in the application - Recovery Mode
---------------------------------------------------

If an error occurs in the application, a dialog box opens with the message
*Unexpected error*. The study may not be saved properly (in the *.hdf* file)
following that. So, in a such case, prefer use *File > Save As* not to erase
the previous content.

When the study is subsequently reloaded, it may be empty in *AsterStudy*.

**Recovery mode**: If the study cannot be restored from the *.hdf* file,
one will automatically try to use the *recovery mode* to restore
the **Current Case** with its **Stages**.

Each time the Study is saved, an additional file is written in the ``xxx_Files``
directory of the Study named ``data.ajs``. If the *.hdf* file is corrupted,
you can use the **Recovery Mode** manually from the *Operations > Recovery Mode*
menu entry. Just select the ``data.ajs`` file to recover.

**Another workaround**: in the *History view*, navigate in the menus to
*Operations > Import Case*, and select the file named *backup.export* in the
*Personal folder* (``$HOME``), then ``.asterstudy/backup``.
This folder always contains the data at the time of the last saving; the
folder ``backup.1`` those at the previous one and so on.
The study must therefore have been saved regularly to retrieve this state.
By default, the directories starting with a dot are hidden. In this case,
just type *.asterstudy* in the text area (if the text area is not visible,
type *Ctrl+L* to show it).

Possible hang up of the lock screen
-----------------------------------

For EDF users, changing network while salome_meca is running may result in
difficulties to log back in. Please be sure to close salome_meca before
changing networks.

**Workaround**: if the user encounters a locking of the log screen, he may
circumvent the problem by killing the process `gvfsd`. This may be done by
logging in a TTY (CTRL+ALT+F1) and then killing the process manually
(`pkill gvfsd`).

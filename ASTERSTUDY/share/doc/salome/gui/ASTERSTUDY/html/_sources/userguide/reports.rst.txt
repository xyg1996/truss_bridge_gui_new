Unused concepts
===============

In order to quickly detect concepts which are not used in the current study
(i.e. which are redundant), it is necessary to:

* Select *Current Case* in the *Data Settings* panel,
* Invoke *Operations > Unused Concepts* menu item.

This menu item opens a dialog which lists all concepts which are not referenced
by any other concept. The user then can select some or all of these concepts and
press *Delete* button to clean-up the study.

    **Unused concepts**

.. warning::
    Last concept in the study is always *unused* by definition.

Validity report
===============

The user can control the validity of the stage being created directly in the
*Data Settings* panel: each command which is invalid from some aspect, is displayed
in red color. The stage is considered invalid if any enclosed concept is invalid.

The object can be invalid due to the following reasons:

* Object is syntaxically invalid (e.g. command misses any mandatory keyword),
* Broken dependency (this can happen if, for instance, some concept referenced by
  other one has been deleted),
* Name conflict (duplicated names are used).

The user can see the validity of selected stage, or a whole case, by invoking 
*Operations > Validity Report* menu.

This menu item opens a dialog that displays validity status for each enclosed
concept, in form of a table. In addition, the user can see if each given concept
is used (referenced by other concepts) or not.

.. _involved_groups:

Involved groups
===============

.. |summary| image:: /images/summary.png
    :height: 24px

Mesh groups used by some concept can be viewed in the following way:

* Select a concept in the *Data Settings* panel,
* Invoke *Groups Involved* item in context menu, or
* Press |summary| button in the *Information* panel.

This opens a *Summary* panel in the lower part of application window.
The panel lists all mesh groups used within the concept, in a form of a table,
where each cell corresponds to some *usage* within the command, with the unique
color assigned to it. A *usage* is a context within the concept in which
particular mesh groups (one separate group, or a list of groups) are used.

In the example below, the concept *bc* produced by **AFFE_CHAR_MECA** command
declares two *usages*:

* *DDL_IMPO / 0*, that uses mesh groups *Cont_mast*, *Cont_slav*, and
* *DDL_IMPO / 1*, that uses mesh groups *Sym_x*, *Sym_y*.

.. code-block:: python

  bc = AFFE_CHAR_MECA(
          DDL_IMPO=(_F(DX=1.0,DY=1.0,DZ=1.0, 
                       GROUP_MA=('Cont_mast', 'Cont_slav')),
                    _F(DX=2.0,DY=2.0,DZ=2.0,
                       GROUP_MA=('Sym_x', 'Sym_y'))), 
          MODELE=model)

For performance reasons *usages* are displayed in the *Summary* panel by chunks;
the chunk size is configured via :ref:`userguide-preferences`. The user can
browse between chunks by pressing *Previous* and *Next* buttons.

.. |show_groups| image:: /images/show_groups.png
    :height: 24px
.. |hide_groups| image:: /images/hide_groups.png
    :height: 24px

User can display selected *usages* in the mesh view by:

* Pressing |show_groups| icon displayed over the *usage*'s legend item in the panel,
* Choosing *Show groups* context menu item,
* Pressing |show_groups| icon in the toolbar.

Similarly, user can erase selected *usages* from the mesh view by:

* Pressing |hide_groups| icon displayed over the *usage*'s legend item in the panel,
* Choosing *Hide groups* context menu item,
* Pressing |hide_groups| icon in the toolbar.

When *usage* is displayed, the mesh groups involved to it are colored in the mesh
view in accordance to the color assigned to the *usage* in the panel; this allows
distinguishing different usages in a view.

.. warning::
    The same mesh group can be assigned to different *usages*; in the mesh view,
    a group will be colored with only one color (most likely that one which is
    assigned to the *lower usage* in the panel; the user will be warned about
    this situation by the corresponding message.

Analysis summary
================

For the commands belonging to the *Analysis* category, the menu operation
*Groups Involved* is not available. Instead, user can open *Summary* panel
either by invoking *Analysis Summary* context menu item, or by pressing
|summary| button in the *Information* panel.

For these commands, *Summary* panel displays all the mesh groups involved
in all the commands which selected command of *Analysis* category depends on,
directly or indirectly.

    **Analysis summary panel**

In this mode, *Summary* panel groups all *usages* by categories; the user can
filter out only *usages* from a particular category by choosing the corresponding
item in the combo box in the panel's toolbar.

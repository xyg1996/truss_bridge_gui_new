Study management is performed via the *File* main menu; this functionality is
inherited from SALOME. The term *study* means a document in SALOME platform.

The user is able to:

* Create new study, by

    * Clicking |study_new| *New document* icon in the toolbar,
    * Using *File > New* main menu,
    * Pressing *Ctrl+N* keyboard shortcut.

* Open existing study, by

    * Clicking |study_open| *Open document* icon in the toolbar,
    * Using *File > Open...* main menu,
    * Pressing *Ctrl+O* keyboard shortcut.

* Saving study to a file, by

    * Clicking |study_save| *Save document* icon in the toolbar,
    * Using *File > Save* or *File > Save As...* main menu,
    * Pressing *Ctrl+S* or *Ctrl+Shift+S* keyboard shortcut.

The main file of the *study* has *.hdf* extension.
Next to this *.hdf* file a directory with the same name and ending with the
*_Files* suffix is created by *AsterStudy* to save additional data. This
directory also contains a text file named ``data.ajs`` that can be used in case
of problem, with the **Recovery Mode** operation (for more details, see
:ref:`userguide-known-issues-recovery-mode`).

Commands management

Commands and concepts
=====================

A result of **Code_Aster** command represents a *concept*; in other words,
concept is a physical entity which is described by the *command* as a
set of named parameters, where each parameter is assigned a specific value.

In below example *mesh* is a concept produced by **LIRE_MAILLAGE** command.

.. code-block:: python

    mesh = LIRE_MAILLAGE(UNITE=20)

Concepts link different commands together - one command can refer to other
by assigning it as a value to some keyword:

.. code-block:: python

    mesh = LIRE_MAILLAGE(UNITE=20, FORMAT='MED')
    model = AFFE_MODELE(MAILLAGE=mesh)

In terms of GUI, *concept* can be considered as a synonym of *command*;
user creates concepts in the study case by adding and configuring commands.

.. note::
    Not all **Code_Aster** commands produce concepts; on the other hand,
    **Code_Aster** command can produce more than one concept.

Add commands to stage (graphical mode)
======================================

In *graphical* mode the addition of a command can be done in several ways:

* Via the dedicated drop-down list in toolbar,
* Via the *Commands* main menu,
* Via the context menu on the stage,
* Via the search dialog for commands (see below).

The commands are sorted by *category* (*Mesh*, *Material* ...).

When a command is added to the stage, the commands are **automatically** sorted
by *category* and taking into account the dependencies between them. It is not
possible to change the order of the commands in the *Data Settings* panel.
If dependencies between commands are added or removed, the order of commands
is automatically recalculated.

.. _search-panel:

Search command
--------------

.. |see_all| image:: /images/see_all.png
    :height: 24px

The search panel is accessible via the |see_all| *Show All* item in the
*Commands* menu.

The search panel shows all the commands grouped by *category*.
The *search* field is used to filter out the commands.

.. note::
    Depending on the version of **Code_Aster** being used, the *categories* can
    be additionally split to the *sub-categories*, which appear as enclosed
    groups in the search panel.

You can then add a command to the selected *graphical* stage by double-clicking
on the command name, or by pressing *OK* or *Apply* button.

.. figure:: /images/search_command.png

    **Show All dialog**

Favorites category
------------------

The user is able to put most oftenly used commands to the **Favorites**
category.

To add a command to the *Favorites* category:

* Open the :ref:`search panel <search-panel>`,
* Select a command,
* Use *Add to Favorites* context menu item.

The *Favorites* category is available as:

* Main menu *Commands > Favorites*,
* Dedicated drop-down list in the *Commands* toolbar,
* A group in the search panel (which appears on a very first place),
* An item in the context menu for the stage in the *Data Settings* panel.

To remove a command from the *Favorites* category:

* Open the :ref:`search panel <search-panel>`,
* Select a command,
* Use *Remove from Favorites* context menu item.

.. warning::
    If *Favorites* category is empty, it is not shown in the toolbar, main menu
    and search panel.

Rename command
--------------

Commands are added to a study with the default name.
You can rename command by editing it or by selecting it in the *Data Settings*
panel and then pressing *F2* key or invoking *Rename* item from the context menu.

Edit command
------------

.. |edit| image:: /images/edit.png
    :height: 24px
.. |hide_unused| image:: /images/eye_off.png
    :height: 24px
.. |command_help| image:: /images/command_help.png
    :height: 24px
.. |edit_comment| image:: /images/edit_comment.png
    :height: 24px
.. |whats_this| image:: /images/whats_this.png
    :height: 24px

    :height: 24px
.. |show_mesh_view| image:: /images/show_mesh_view.png
    :height: 24px
.. |summary| image:: /images/summary.png
    :height: 24px

To edit a command, double-click the item in the *Data Settings* panel, or select
a command and press *F4*, click |edit| toolbar button or invoke *Edit* item from
the context menu.

.. figure:: /images/edit_command.png
    :alt: Edit command
    :align: center

    **Edit command**

The *Name* field is used to rename the command.

The |command_help| button opens a documentation on the command. This operation
is also available in the *Edit* main menu and in context menu in *Data Settings*
panel.

The |hide_unused| button allows to display only selected parameters.

The |edit_comment| button allows
:ref:`adding comment to a command <edit-comment>`.

The |use_translations| button switches ON/OFF
:ref:`business-oriented translations <business-translations>`.

The |show_mesh_view| button allows switching mesh view ON/OFF. Switching
mesh view OFF can be useful when working with the mesh containing big number
of groups, to have reasonable performance (as groups visualization is quite
time-consuming).

The |summary| button opens :ref:`involved_groups` panel that allows viewing mesh
groups used by the command being edited.

The |whats_this| button displays a description of selected keyword:

.. figure:: /images/show_whats_this.png
    :alt: What's This
    :align: center

    **What's This**

The user can then enter the parameters of the command by checking the box of
the parameter to be filled in and then specifying its value.

.. note::
    Mandatory parameters are followed by a red asterisk.

The parameter value can be given via either a text or numeric field, a drop-down
list or, for more complex parameters, an *Edit* button to access a subscreen for
editing this parameter.

The following screen shows the editing of the `Timestepping` parameter.

.. figure:: /images/edit_command_sub.png
    :alt: Edition of parameter
    :align: center

    **Edition of parameter**

.. hint::
    The second line (`Linear thermal analysis > Timestepping`) allows you to
    find your way through the sequence of screens.

Delete or copy command
----------------------

The command can be deleted or duplicated via the corresponding toolbar
button, menu, or keyboard shortcut (*Del* and *Ctrl+D* respectively).

.. important::
    The order of the commands and the validation are carried out during the
    suppression of a command to check that the integrity of the stage is
    respected.

Activate / deactivate command
-----------------------------

A command can be temporarily removed from the stage by using *Deactivate*
operation. Deactivated commands are shown grayed in the *Data Settings* panel.

.. figure:: /images/deactivated_command.png
    :alt: Deactivated command
    :align: center

    **Deactivated command**

All usual operations are allowed for deactivated commands; however, they are
not shown in the drop-down selectors when editing other commands. In addition,
when stage is converted to the *text* mode or exported to a command file,
deactivated commands appear as comment blocks.

Deactivated command can be re-activated via the *Activate* operation.

*Deactivate* and *Activate* operations are available in:

* *Edit* main menu,
* Context menu of a command in *Data Settings* panel.

.. _edit-comment:

Add comment
-----------

The button |edit_comment| edits the comment associated with the command.

.. _userguide-edit-text-stage:

Find
====

It is possible to search the study tree. To do this, select the *Data Settings*
panel and press *Ctrl+F*, use *Find* context menu or *Edit > Find* main menu.

The search box appears at the bottom of the study tree.

It is possible to search on the following criteria:

* *Command*: search by Aster command names.
    * Example: if the user types `DEF`, items created by commands like
      `DEFI_MATERIAU` are highlighted.
* *Concept*: search by the names of existing concepts.
    * Example: if the user types `MAT`, the item corresponding to the command
      `MATE = AFFE_MATERIAU (...)` is highlighted.
* *Keyword*: search by the keywords of the commands.
    * Example: `COMMAND (GROUP_MA=ALPHA)` is highlighted, if user types
      `GROUP`.
* *Group*: search on the names of groups of mesh nodes or elements.
    * Example: `COMMAND (GROUP_MA=BETA)` is highlighted, if the user types
      `BET`.
* *Value*: search is performed within keyword values.
    * Example: `COMMAND (ARGUMENT=123)` is highlighted, if the user types
      `123`. Note that *Group* search type is a particular case of *Value*.
* *All*: search contains results from all other modes. This is the default
  search mode.

.. important::
    In *Concept* mode, the search tool finds concepts recursively, i.e. if one
    concept refers to another one which name suits the search criterion, this
    first concept is also included into the search result.

    * Example: if the user types `MESH`, the item corresponding to the command
      `MODEL = AFFE_MODELE(MAILLAGE=MESH)` is also highlighted, in addition to
      the `MESH` item itself.

The nodes of the study corresponding to the search criterion entered by the user
are then highlighted in yellow background, and it is possible to navigate
between them by clicking *<* (previous result) and *>* (next result) buttons
or pressing *F3*, *Shift+F3* shortcuts.

The search is case insensitive and is performed on the words **containing**
the value entered by the user.

Edition in text mode
====================

In *text* mode, the stage is managed as a whole and the commands that compose
it are not displayed in the *Data Settings* panel under the stage item.

To edit the commands for a stage in *text* mode, double-click on the stage item
in the *Data Settings* panel, press *F4*, use *Edit* context menu command to
open the text editor or click |edit| toolbar button.

.. figure:: /images/text_mode.png
    :alt: Edit stage in text mode
    :align: center

    **Edit stage in text mode**

.. note::
    It is possible to use either an internal editor or an external editor
    program (see :ref:`userguide-preferences`).

In addition to editing command file representing the stage in *text* mode, the
user is able to declare the concepts which are created in the study by this
stage (right part of the dialog on above picture). The concepts entered here
will be available for the selection in the following *graphical* stages.

.. warning::
    Application cannot check that concepts declared by the user are actually
    created by the stage. This is the responsibility of the user to provide
    correct information.

.. important::
    User can also declare concepts created in the *text* stage with the
    *Edit concepts* operation which is available in *Edit* main menu and in
    the context menu for the stage in the *Data Settings* panel.

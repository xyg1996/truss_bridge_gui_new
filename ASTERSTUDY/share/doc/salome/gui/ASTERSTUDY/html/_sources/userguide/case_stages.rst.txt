Case and stages
***************

In terms of **Code_Aster** a study case is described as a sequence of commands.
This sequence is fed to **Code_Aster** solver as one or more command files (which
normally have *.com?* extension, e.g. aaa.comm, aaa.com1, aaa.com2, etc).

In *AsterStudy* application, study case is represented as a set of stages, and
each stage corresponds to a separate command file. 

Case
====

When a study is created, an empty **case** is automatically added. The *case*
represents a particular *Aster* study case within the application.

Content of the case is filled in by means of various editing operations. In
addition to the **Current Case** which always represents a case being edited
by the user, there can be other types of cases:

* **Run cases**: these are cases which contain results of **Code_Aster**
  calculations,
* **Backup cases**: backup copies of the *Current Case*.

For more details about features related to the cases, refer to the
:ref:`userguide-case_management` chapter.

Stages
======

A case is composed of **stages** representing the different phases of the
*Aster* calculation.

Graphical mode and text mode of the stages
------------------------------------------

The stages can be managed either in *graphical* or in *text* mode.

The **graphical** mode is used to manage the stages by filling them via
input panels in the application's interface.

The **text** mode lets the user entering *Aster* commands. This mode can be
used, for instance, to apply features of **Code_Aster**.

.. |stage_graphical| image:: /images/stage_graphical.png
.. |stage_text| image:: /images/stage_text.png

The stages in *graphical* mode are represented in the *Data Settings* panel by
the |stage_graphical| icon, and those in *text* mode by the |stage_text| icon.

.. important::
    *By default* the stages are created in *graphical* mode.

It is possible to change the mode of a stage via the context menu or
*Operations* menu.

.. warning::
    A warning message is displayed if the application cannot convert
    a stage from *text* mode to *graphical* mode.

Add stage
---------

.. |stage_new| image:: /images/stage_new.png
    :height: 24px

To add a stage, perform any of below listed actions:

* Click on the |stage_new| *Add stage* icon of the toolbar,
* Use *Operations > Add Stage* menu,
* Use *Add Stage* context menu on the case in the *Data Settings* panel,
* Use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+N*.

New stages are automatically named by the application.
It is possible to rename the stage by selecting it in the *Data Settings* panel
and then using the *Rename* context menu, or by pressing the keyboard
shortcut *F2*.

Import stage
------------

.. |stage_import| image:: /images/stage_import.png
    :height: 24px

It is possible to import an *Aster* command file as a case stage.

For this you can either:

* Click the |stage_import| *Add stage from file* icon of the toolbar,
* Use the *Operations > Add Stage from File* menu,
* Use *Add Stage from File* context menu on the case in the *Data Settings* panel,
* Use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+I*.

.. important::
    The application parses the command file and creates a stage in the
    *graphical* mode from the contents of the file. If the file contains commands
    that cannot be interpreted by the application, the stage will be created in
    *text* mode with the contents of the file.

Also, it is possible to import *Aster* command file as a stage in *text* mode,
i.e. without its automatic conversion to the *graphical* mode. This can be done
by:

* Using the *Operations > Add Text Stage from File* menu,
* Using *Add Text Stage from File* context menu on the case in the
  *Data Settings* panel.

Import stage from template
--------------------------

It is possible to create a stage by importing *Aster* command file from the
predefined template. The template command files can be created by the user in
the ``~/.config/salome/asterstudy_templates`` directory. These files appear as
items in:

* *Operations > Add Stage from Template* and *Operations > Add Text Stage from Template*
  main menus,
* *Add Stage from Template* and *Add Text Stage from Template* sub-menus in
  the case's context menu in *Data Settings* panel.

.. important::
    Some predefined templates may be supplied with the *AsterStudy* application.

Add stage with assistant
------------------------

Another way to add a stage to the study case consists in using *Calculation Assistant*.

A *Calculation Assistant* is a predefined study accompanied by a graphical
interface allowing the user to enter certain parameters, and thus to be able
to quickly start a calculation.

Several calculation assistants are supplied with the *AsterStdudy* application;
user's assistants are located in the ``~/.config/salome/asterstudy_assistants``
directory. These assistants appear as items in:

* *Operations > Add Stage with Assistant* main menu,
* *Add Stage with Assistant* sub-menu in the case's context menu in
  *Data Settings* panel.

To learn more about *Calculation Assistant* feature (in particular, how to
implement and embed own assistants), refer to the :ref:`assistant`

Export stage
------------

.. |stage_export| image:: /images/stage_export.png
    :height: 24px

Similarly, it is possible to export a stage to an *Aster* command file:

* Click the |stage_export| *Export command file* icon of the toolbar,
* Use the *Operation > Export Command File* menu,
* Use the *Export Command File* context menu on the stage in the *Data Settings*
  panel,
* Use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+E*.

If the stage is in *graphical* mode, the command file is generated from the
commands defined in the stage; if the stage is in *text* mode, the content of
the stage is directly exported to the file.

Rename stage
------------

Stages are added to a study with the default name.
To rename a stage, select it in the *Data Settings* panel and then:

* Use *Edit > Rename* main menu,
* Use *Rename* context menu item,
* Press *F2* key.

Delete stage
------------

.. |stage_delete| image:: /images/delete.png
    :height: 24px

A stage can be removed from the case by clicking |stage_delete| toolbar button,
choosing *Delete* menu item, or pressing *Del* on the keyboard.

.. warning::
    Deleting of a stage will automatically remove all stages which follow it.
